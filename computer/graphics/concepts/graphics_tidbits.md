# Graphics Programming

## MIPs

In the context of graphics programming, MIP (Mipmap) is a term used to describe
a set of pre-calculated, optimized images that are used to improve the quality
and performance of texture mapping in 3D graphics. A MIP map is a pyramid of
images, each of which is a progressively smaller version of the original image.
When a MIP map is used for texture mapping, the graphics processor selects the
appropriate MIP level based on the size of the texture on the screen and the
distance from the viewer, which helps to reduce aliasing and improve
performance.

MIP maps are commonly used in 3D graphics to improve the quality of texture
mapping, especially when the texture is viewed from a distance or is stretched
over a large area. By using MIP maps, graphics programmers can achieve higher
quality and more realistic texture mapping with fewer resources, which can be
especially important in resource-constrained environments such as mobile
devices or game consoles.

## Albedo

Albedo is a term used in physics and astronomy to describe the reflectivity of
a surface. It is defined as the ratio of the amount of light that is reflected
by a surface to the amount of light that is incident upon it. Albedo is
typically expressed as a percentage or decimal value, with values ranging from
0 (a completely non-reflective surface) to 1 (a perfectly reflective surface).

In the context of planetary science, albedo is often used to describe the
reflectivity of a planet's surface or atmosphere. For example, the albedo of
Earth's surface is about 0.3, which means that about 30% of the sunlight that
hits the Earth's surface is reflected back into space. The albedo of a planet
can be affected by various factors, such as the composition of its surface
materials, the presence of clouds or other atmospheric phenomena, and the angle
of the sun relative to the planet's surface.

In the field of computer graphics, albedo is often used to describe the color
and reflectivity of a surface in a 3D model or scene. In this context, albedo
is typically represented as a color value, and it is used to determine how
light is reflected off of the surface and how it contributes to the overall
lighting of the scene.

## Billboard

In the context of graphics programming, a billboard is a type of 3D object that
is always oriented towards the camera, regardless of the camera's position or
orientation. Billboards are often used to represent flat, two-dimensional
objects that are part of a 3D scene, such as trees, bushes, signs, or other
objects that are not meant to be viewed from multiple angles.

To create a billboard in 3D graphics, you typically define a mesh or geometry
that represents the flat object, and then apply a transformation that aligns
the billboard with the camera. This transformation can be achieved through a
variety of techniques, such as using a view-aligned coordinate system or
applying a rotation that aligns the billboard with the camera's up and right
vectors.

Billboards are often used in 3D graphics to improve performance and reduce the
complexity of rendering scenes with large numbers of flat objects. By using
billboards, you can avoid the overhead of rendering multiple copies of the same
object from different angles, and you can use a single draw call to render many
billboards at once. However, billboards do have some limitations, such as
reduced realism when viewed from certain angles, and the inability to represent
objects that are not perfectly flat.

## Shadow Volume Texture

Shadow volume texture is a technique used in 3D graphics to efficiently render
shadows from dynamic light sources. It works by rendering the shadows as a 3D
texture that is mapped onto the surface of the objects in the scene. This
allows the shadows to be rendered with a single draw call, which can be more
efficient than rendering each shadow as a separate object.

The shadow volume texture is typically generated by rendering the scene from
the perspective of the light source, and using the depth buffer to create a 3D
texture that represents the visibility of the scene from the light's point of
view. This texture is then applied to the surface of the objects in the scene,
using a special shader that computes the shadowing effect based on the depth
values in the shadow volume texture.

One of the advantages of shadow volume texture is that it allows you to render
shadows from dynamic light sources that are moving or changing shape, without
the need to re-compute the shadow geometry or update the shadow map. It also
allows you to render shadows that are self-occluding, which means that the
shadows are correctly occluded by other objects in the scene. However, shadow
volume texture can be more computationally expensive than other shadow
rendering techniques, and it may not always produce the most realistic or
accurate shadows.

## Screenspace Reflection

Screen space reflection (SSR) is a technique used in 3D graphics to simulate
reflections on the surface of objects in a scene. It works by rendering the
reflections as an image that is overlaid on top of the main 3D view, using
information about the position, orientation, and surface properties of the
objects in the scene.

To implement SSR, you typically need to render the scene from the perspective
of the camera, and use a special shader to compute the reflections for each
pixel on the screen. This shader typically takes into account the surface
normal, roughness, and reflectivity of the object at each pixel, as well as the
position and orientation of the camera and the light sources in the scene.

The reflections in an SSR-based rendering are usually generated by tracing rays
from the camera into the scene and computing the color and intensity of the
light that is reflected back to the camera. This can be done using a variety of
techniques, such as ray tracing or rasterization, depending on the needs and
capabilities of the rendering engine.

One of the advantages of SSR is that it allows you to render realistic
reflections on the surface of objects in real time, without the need to
pre-compute or store large reflection maps or environment maps. However, SSR
can be computationally expensive, especially for scenes with many reflective
surfaces or complex lighting conditions, and it may not always produce the most
accurate or realistic reflections.

## Lumen

In the context of graphics programming, the term "lumen" typically refers to a
unit of luminous flux, which is a measure of the amount of light that is
emitted by a source. Lumens are often used to specify the brightness or
intensity of a light source in a 3D scene, and they can be used to calculate
the amount of light that is received by an object or surface in the scene.

To use lumens in graphics programming, you typically need to specify the
luminous flux of a light source in your 3D scene, either as an absolute value
or as a relative value compared to other light sources in the scene. You can
then use this value to compute the amount of light that is received by an
object or surface, based on the distance between the light source and the
object, the surface normal of the object, and any other factors that might
affect the amount of light that is received (such as the presence of occluding
objects or the surface properties of the object).

Lumens are often used in conjunction with other units of measure in graphics
programming, such as candelas (a measure of luminous intensity), lux (a measure
of illuminance), or photons (a measure of light energy). By using these units
together, you can more accurately specify the brightness, intensity, and
distribution of light in your 3D scenes, and you can use this information to
create more realistic and visually compelling graphics.

## DFAO

DFAO stands for "depth-aware order-independent transparency," which is a
technique used in 3D graphics to render transparent objects with correct
ordering and minimal artifacts.

In 3D graphics, transparent objects can be challenging to render correctly,
especially when they overlap or intersect with other objects in the scene. This
is because the order in which the objects are drawn can affect the final
appearance of the image, and it can be difficult to determine the correct order
without introducing visual artifacts or incorrect occlusion.

DFAO is a technique that aims to address these challenges by using depth
information to correctly order the transparent objects in the scene, and by
using a special shading algorithm to minimize the visual artifacts that can
occur when transparent objects overlap or intersect. This can help to create
more realistic and visually compelling 3D graphics, especially when rendering
scenes with many transparent objects or complex transparency effects.

To implement DFAO, you typically need to use a special shader or rendering
technique that takes into account the depth of the transparent objects in the
scene, and that uses this depth information to correctly order the objects for
rendering. You may also need to use additional techniques or algorithms to
minimize the artifacts that can occur when transparent objects overlap or
intersect.

## Spot and Capsule Lights

In 3D rendering, a spot light is a type of light source that emits light in a
narrow cone or beam, with a defined angle of spread and a falloff region at the
edges of the cone. Spot lights are often used to simulate the beam of light
that is emitted by a flashlight, a car headlight, or other similar sources.

A capsule light, on the other hand, is a type of light source that is shaped
like a capsule or cylinder, and that emits light from all points along the
length of the capsule. Capsule lights are often used to simulate the diffuse
lighting that is emitted by a fluorescent tube, a neon sign, or other similar
sources.

The main difference between a spot light and a capsule light is the shape and
intensity of the light that they emit. Spot lights emit a narrow beam of light
with a defined angle of spread, while capsule lights emit a more diffuse and
uniformly distributed light. This difference can affect the way that the light
interacts with the objects and surfaces in a 3D scene, and it can influence the
appearance of shadows and reflections.

In general, spot lights are more focused and directional, and they are often
used to create more specular and directional lighting effects. Capsule lights,
on the other hand, are more diffuse and omnidirectional, and they are often
used to create more diffuse and ambient lighting effects.
