# Place Value

In mathematics, place value refers to the value of a digit in a number based on
its position in the number. The place value of a digit is determined by the
place it occupies in a number.

For example, in the number 123, the digit 1 has a place value of 100, the digit
2 has a place value of 10, and the digit 3 has a place value of 1. In this way,
the place value of a digit can be thought of as the number of times the digit
is used in a multiple of the base of the numbering system. In the base 10
system that is commonly used in mathematics, the place value of a digit is
determined by the number of times it is used in a power of 10.

Place value is an important concept in mathematics, as it allows us to
represent and communicate large numbers using a smaller number of digits. It is
also used in operations such as addition and subtraction, as well as in more
advanced mathematical concepts such as decimals and scientific notation.
