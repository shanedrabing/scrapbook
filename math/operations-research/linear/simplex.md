# Simplex Method

The simplex method is an algorithm for solving linear programming problems,
which are optimization problems that involve finding the values of variables
that maximize or minimize a linear objective function subject to a set of
linear constraints. The simplex method is a widely used and powerful tool for
solving linear programming problems, and it is one of the most important
algorithms in operations research.

The simplex method works by iteratively improving a feasible solution to the
linear programming problem until an optimal solution is found. At each
iteration, the simplex method selects a pivot element in the current solution
and performs a sequence of elementary row operations to generate a new solution
that is better than the current one. The process continues until the objective
function reaches its optimal value, at which point the simplex method
terminates.

The simplex method is often used in operations research to solve a wide range
of problems, including resource allocation problems, scheduling problems, and
production planning problems. It is also used in many other fields, including
finance, economics, and engineering.
