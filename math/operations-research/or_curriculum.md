# Intro to Operations Research

Operations research (OR) is a branch of mathematics that deals with decision
making and optimization under uncertainty. It is often used to solve complex
problems in a wide range of fields, including engineering, management,
economics, and computer science.

OR techniques are used to analyze and improve the efficiency, effectiveness,
and reliability of systems and processes, and to make better decisions under
uncertainty and constraint. OR methods are based on mathematical modeling,
statistical analysis, and optimization techniques, and they are often used to
solve problems involving resource allocation, scheduling, routing, and decision
making.

OR is related to several other fields, including computer science, industrial
engineering, management science, and economics. It is also closely related to
other branches of applied mathematics, such as mathematical programming,
stochastic modeling, and simulation.
