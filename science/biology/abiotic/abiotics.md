Here are a few examples of non-living things that share characteristics with
living things, but are not hypothetical:

- Viruses: Viruses are small infectious agents that are made up of genetic
  material (such as DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat. They are able to
  infect living cells and replicate themselves, but they are not considered to
  be living organisms because they are not able to perform vital functions such
  as metabolism and reproduction on their own. Instead, they rely on the
  metabolic machinery of the host cells they infect to replicate.

- Crystals: Crystals are solid substances that are made up of atoms or
  molecules arranged in a repeating, orderly pattern. Some crystals, such as
  quartz or diamond, are able to grow and change over time, and they are able
  to perform certain functions such as transmitting light or electrical
  signals. However, they are not considered to be living because they do not
  have the ability to perform vital functions such as metabolism and
  reproduction.

- Fire: Fire is a chemical reaction that involves the rapid oxidation of a
  fuel, such as wood or gasoline, accompanied by the production of heat, light,
  and other byproducts. Fire is able to consume and transform materials, and it
  is able to spread and propagate itself. However, it is not considered to be
  living because it does not have the ability to perform vital functions such
  as metabolism and reproduction.
