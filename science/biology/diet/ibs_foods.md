# Foods for IBS

In addition to fiber, there are several other foods and dietary strategies that
may help to manage symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

- Probiotics: Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that live in the gut and help
  to promote a healthy balance of gut microflora. They can be found in
  fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickles, as
  well as in supplements.

- Low FODMAP diet: FODMAPs are a group of short-chain carbohydrates that can be
  poorly absorbed in the gut and can cause symptoms such as gas, bloating, and
  diarrhea in people with IBS. A low FODMAP diet involves eliminating high
  FODMAP foods, such as certain fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products,
  for a period of time and then gradually reintroducing them to identify which
  ones trigger symptoms.

- Soluble fiber: As mentioned before, soluble fiber can help to regulate bowel
  movements and reduce symptoms such as constipation and diarrhea. Foods that
  are high in soluble fiber include oats, barley, fruits (such as oranges,
  apples, and pears), vegetables (such as carrots, Brussels sprouts, and
  broccoli), and legumes (such as peas, lentils, and beans).

- Anti-inflammatory foods: Certain foods, such as omega-3 fatty acids (found in
  fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel) ginger, turmeric, garlic,
  berries (strawberries, blueberries).

## FODMAPs

FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides,
and Polyols. These are a group of short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly
absorbed in the gut and can cause symptoms such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea
in people with IBS.

FODMAPs include:

- Oligosaccharides: fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides (found in wheat,
  barley, onions, garlic, and legumes)
- Disaccharides: lactose (found in milk, yogurt, and soft cheeses)
- Monosaccharides: fructose (found in fruits such as apples, pears, and mangos,
  as well as in honey and high fructose corn syrup)
- Polyols: sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol and maltitol (found in certain fruits
  and vegetables such as avocados, apricots, and mushrooms, as well as in
  sugar-free gum and candy)

A low FODMAP diet involves eliminating high FODMAP foods, such as certain
fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products, for a period of time and then
gradually reintroducing them to identify which ones trigger symptoms. This
approach has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of IBS, but it is
important to be supervised by a dietitian or healthcare provider to ensure that
the diet is balanced and nutritionally adequate.

It's also important to note that a low FODMAP diet is not intended to be a
long-term diet, but rather a tool for identifying trigger foods and for
temporary symptom relief. Once the trigger foods have been identified, it is
recommended to incorporate them back into the diet in small amounts, to achieve
a more balanced and varied diet over time.

It's also important to note that a low FODMAP diet is not suitable for everyone
and it's important to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered
dietitian before starting the diet, as it can be restrictive and may cause
nutrient deficiencies if not followed properly.
