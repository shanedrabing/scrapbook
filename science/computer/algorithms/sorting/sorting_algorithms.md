# Sorting Algorithms

Algorithm|At Worst|Memory|Description
-|-|-|-
Bubble|O(n^2)|O(1)|Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
Insertion|O(n^2)|O(1)|Works by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist.
Quick|O(n^2)|O(log(n))|Divide-and-conquer; partitions the list based on a pivot element.
Merge|O(n*log(n))|O(n)|Divide-and-conquer; sorts sublists and then merges them back together.
