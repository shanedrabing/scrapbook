ChatGPT is changing the game, and I want to share real things you can do with
this AI system today.

Please save this post and start testing this technology NOW so you're ahead of
the curve.

## Summary

Copy and paste an article, and ask, "can you summarize this article in one
paragraph in a way that a 5th grader could understand it?"

## Coding

Ask it to write basic scripts or even more qualitative questions like "what is
the most efficient way to loop through a list in Python?"

## Planning

Think of an overwhelming task you have on your plate and a reasonable timeline,
and ask, "create a schedule for me to launch my new machine learning startup by
May 1, 2023? Please include deliverables, timelines, contingency planning, team
bonding, breaks, brainstorming, and user testing."

## Creativity

Think of something you want to shake up in your life and ask, "I'm going to
turn 40-years-old soon and I want to celebrate my birthday in a new and
different way that incorporates my passions. I love archery, Korean BBQ,
musicals, and axe throwing. What are three ideas for a birthday that costs
under $2000 and can accommodate 10 people?"

## Writer's Block

Do you have an email or blog post you've been meaning to write but need a
little push? Just ask, "write a nice email to Tom that asks him if he enjoyed
the offsite, and then to update his monthly report and send me his promotion
document." Use that as a foundation, then edit or tweak as needed.

## Motivation

AI is not a replacement for trained medical professionals, but if you're
feeling a little low you can ask, "can you give me three motivational phrases
to help me get through a hard day when I'm low on sleep?"

## Endnotes

And that's just the beginning.

Is the tool perfect? Absolutely not. I've explored these flaws in countless
postsâ€”bias, data privacy, homogeneity, centralization, accuracy, reliance,
plagiarism, job shifts, just to name a few.

But part of preparing for the future means understanding it.

And understanding it often means trying it, testing it, breaking it.

AI is not science fiction. It's not a thought experiment from the 60s or a
movie you watched in the 90s.

It's here.
