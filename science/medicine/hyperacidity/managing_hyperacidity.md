# Managing Hyperacidity

Hyperacidity, also known as hyperchlorhydria, is a condition characterized by
the overproduction of stomach acid. It can cause symptoms such as heartburn,
indigestion, and nausea. Hyperacidity can be caused by a variety of factors,
including certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, and certain
medical conditions, such as acid reflux disease (GERD) or peptic ulcer disease.
If left untreated, hyperacidity can lead to serious complications, such as
ulcers or damage to the esophagus. Treatment for hyperacidity may involve
medications to reduce the production of stomach acid, as well as lifestyle
changes to avoid foods and drinks that can irritate the stomach lining and to
reduce stress. It is important to speak with a healthcare provider if you are
experiencing symptoms of hyperacidity.
