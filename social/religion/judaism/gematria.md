# Gematria

The word "gematria" comes from the Greek word "geōmetriā," which means
"geometry." Gematria is a form of numerology that is based on the system of
assigning numerical values to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and it is
often used as a tool for studying the Torah and other Jewish texts.

The practice of gematria dates back to ancient times, and it has been used in
various forms in many different cultures and religions. In Judaism, gematria is
often used as a way to explore the symbolic and spiritual meanings of numbers
and letters in the Hebrew language, and it is based on the idea that there are
hidden connections and correspondences between words and concepts that can be
revealed through the study of numerology.

The roots of gematria can be traced back to the ancient Greek philosophers, who
believed that mathematics and geometry were fundamental to the understanding of
the universe. The use of gematria in Judaism may have been influenced by the
Greek fascination with mathematics and geometry, and it may have evolved as a
way to explore the deeper meanings and connections that could be found in the
Hebrew language and in the texts of Judaism.
